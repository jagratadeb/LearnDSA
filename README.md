## Project Overview

**LearnDSA** is a comprehensive collection of code examples, notes, and patterns designed to help learners and developers master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C and C++. The repository is organized by topic, covering fundamental concepts, advanced techniques, and practical coding patterns. It serves as a reference and practice resource for students, educators, and professionals preparing for technical interviews or deepening their understanding of DSA.

## Directory and File Structure

Below is an organized overview of the repository's structure, with brief descriptions for each folder:

### 01 Basic Concepts/
- **Purpose:** Foundational programming concepts in C/C++.
  - [`01 For Each Loop`](./01%20Basic%20Concepts/01%20For%20Each%20Loop/): Demonstrates the use of for-each loops in C++ for iterating over collections.
  - [`02 Structures`](./01%20Basic%20Concepts/02%20Structures/): Introduction to user-defined data types using structures in C.
  - [`03 Pointers`](./01%20Basic%20Concepts/03%20Pointers/): Basics of pointers, pointer arithmetic, and pointers with structures in C.
  - [`04 Reference`](./01%20Basic%20Concepts/04%20Reference/): Reference variables and their usage in C++ for efficient memory access.
  - [`05 Functions`](./01%20Basic%20Concepts/05%20Functions/): Function concepts including arrays as parameters, modular vs. monolithic code, parameter passing, and functions with structures.
  - [`06 Object Orientation`](./01%20Basic%20Concepts/06%20Object%20Orientation/): Stepwise examples illustrating object-oriented programming concepts in C++ (classes, objects, encapsulation, etc.).
  - [`07 Patterns`](./01%20Basic%20Concepts/07%20Patterns/): C++ programs for various pattern printing problems (rectangles, pyramids, diamonds, triangles, and more).

### 02 Main Concepts/
- **Purpose:** Core DSA topics and advanced programming techniques.
  - [`01 Recursion`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/01%20Recursion/): Recursion basics, factorial, Fibonacci series, and recursive algorithms. 
  - [`02 Array Basics`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/02%20Array%20Basics/): Array declaration, memory layout, static/dynamic allocation, and 2D arrays in C/C++.
  - [`03 Array ADT`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/03%20Array%20ADT/): Array Abstract Data Type operationsâ€”creation, modification, searching, analysis, rearrangement, set operations, and menu-driven programs (organized by subfolder).
  - [`04 Strings`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/04%20Strings/): String declaration, manipulation, validation, reversal, comparison, palindrome checks, and more.
  - [`05 Matrix`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/05%20Matrix/): Matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition.
  - [`06 Polynomials`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/06%20Polynomials/): Implementation of polynomial data structures and algorithms for polynomial addition, multiplication, and evaluation.
  - [`07 Linked List`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/07%20Linked%20List/): Singly and doubly (both circular and linear) linked list implementations, including insertion, deletion, traversal, and common linked list algorithms.
  - [`08 Stack`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/08%20Stack/): Stack data structure implementation using arrays and linked lists, including operations like push, pop, and stack applications (e.g., expression evaluation).
