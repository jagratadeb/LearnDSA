# LearnDSA

## Project Overview

**LearnDSA** is a comprehensive collection of code examples, notes, and patterns designed to help learners and developers master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C and C++. The repository is organized by topic, covering fundamental concepts, advanced techniques, and practical coding patterns. It serves as a reference and practice resource for students, educators, and professionals preparing for technical interviews or deepening their understanding of DSA.

## Directory and File Structure

Below is an organized overview of the repository's structure, with brief descriptions for each folder and file:

### 01 Basic Concepts/

    - `01structure.c`: Introduction to structures in C.
  - **03 Pointers/**
    - `01pointer.c`: Basics of pointers in C.
    - `01structPointer.c`: Using pointers with structures.
  - **04 Reference/**
    - `01reference.cpp`: Reference variables and their usage in C++.
  - **05 Functions/**
    - **Array/**, **Modular Code/**, **Monolithic Code/**, **Pass Parameter in Func/**, **Structure/**: Subfolders for function-related examples (add files as needed).
  - **06 Object Orientation/**
    - `001OOPExample1.cpp` to `006OOPExample6.cpp`: Stepwise examples illustrating object-oriented programming concepts in C++.
  - **07 Patterns/**
    - `01SolidRectangle.cpp` to `25HollowSquare.cpp`: C++ programs for various pattern printing problems (rectangles, pyramids, diamonds, triangles, etc.).

### 02 Main Concepts/
- **Purpose:** Core DSA topics and advanced programming techniques.
  - [`01 Recursion`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/01%20Recursion/): Recursion basics, factorial, Fibonacci series, and recursive algorithms. 
  - [`02 Array Basics`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/02%20Array%20Basics/): Array declaration, memory layout, static/dynamic allocation, and 2D arrays in C/C++.
  - [`03 Array ADT`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/03%20Array%20ADT/): Array Abstract Data Type operationsâ€”creation, modification, searching, analysis, rearrangement, set operations, and menu-driven programs (organized by subfolder).
  - [`04 Strings`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/04%20Strings/): String declaration, manipulation, validation, reversal, comparison, palindrome checks, and more.
  - [`05 Matrix`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/05%20Matrix/): Matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition.
  - [`06 Polynomials`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/06%20Polynomials/): Implementation of polynomial data structures and algorithms for polynomial addition, multiplication, and evaluation.
  - [`07 Linked List`](./02%20Main%20Concepts/07%20Linked%20List/): Singly and doubly linked list implementations, including insertion, deletion, traversal, and common linked list algorithms.


## How to Use This Repository

### Prerequisites
- **Compiler:** GCC (MinGW recommended for Windows) for C/C++ code.
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code or any C/C++ compatible IDE.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jagratadeb/LearnDSA.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd LearnDSA
   ```
3. **Open in VS Code (optional):**
   ```sh
   code .
   ```

### Building and Running Code
- **C/C++ Files:**
  - Use the provided VS Code build task (`C/C++: gcc.exe build active file`) to compile the currently open file.
  - Or, compile manually:
    ```sh
    gcc <filename.c> -o <output.exe>
    ./<output.exe>
    ```
    For C++ files, use `g++` instead of `gcc`.

### Contributing
- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your code improvements or additions.
- **New codes will not be accepted (only simplifications and improvements are allowed).**
- Follow the existing structure for adding new code.
- Add your code or documentation in the appropriate folder.
- **Ensure code is well-commented and follows the existing structure.**
