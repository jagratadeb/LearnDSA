## Folder Structure

### LearnDSA

#### 01 Basic Concepts
- **01 For Each Loop**: Contains examples demonstrating the use of `for-each` loops in C++.
- **02 Structures**: Includes programs showcasing the use of structures in C.
- **03 Pointers**: Covers basic pointer operations and pointers to structures in C.
- **04 Reference**: Demonstrates the use of references in C++.
- **05 Functions**: Contains subfolders with examples of passing arrays, modular and monolithic code, and passing parameters by value, address, and reference.
  - **Array**: Examples of passing arrays to functions and returning arrays.
  - **Modular Code**: Demonstrates modular programming techniques.
  - **Monolithic Code**: Examples of monolithic programming.
  - **Pass Parameter in Func**: Programs showing different ways to pass parameters to functions.
  - **Structure**: Examples of using structures as function parameters.
- **06 Object Orientation**: Contains multiple examples demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts in C++.

#### 02 Main Concepts
- **01 Recursion**: Includes subfolders for global and static variables, types of recursion, and iterative vs recursive examples.
  - **1 Global And Static Variables**: Programs demonstrating the use of global and static variables in recursion.
  - **2 Types of Recursion**: Examples of tail, head, tree, indirect, and nested recursion.
  - **Recursion**: Contains iterative and recursive examples for problems like sum of numbers, factorial, power, Fibonacci, and Taylor series.
- **02 Array Basics**: Programs covering array declaration, addressing, static and dynamic arrays, and creating 2D arrays using different methods.
- **03 Array ADT**: Comprehensive examples of array operations, including creating arrays in heap and stack memory, displaying elements, appending, inserting, deleting, and searching using linear and binary search techniques. Additionally, programs cover advanced operations like getting and setting elements, finding maximum and minimum values, calculating sum and average, rearranging negative and positive numbers, checking if an array is sorted,inserting elements into sorted arrays, merging arrays and set operations.
