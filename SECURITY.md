# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This repository contains **DSA practice code**.  
All code is purely algorithmic and runs independently.  
There are no versions with security patches because the code is not part of a deployable system.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Since this project is a **learning archive** and not a production application:
- There are no known security risks in the code.
- If you notice an error in logic or implementation, you may open an **Issue** for discussion.
- Please do not submit security vulnerability reports, as this repository does not handle sensitive data or external inputs.

## Disclaimer
This repository is intended for **educational purposes only**.  
It should not be used directly in production systems without proper validation, testing, and security review.
